                  Doug Rohde's Utilities C Library
                             version 2.21

This package includes the source code for compiling a C library that includes
many useful functions for a variety of things.  This library is used by many
of the programs written by Doug Rohde, including TGrep2 and SLG.

To build the libdrutils.a library, run make.  You may find that you must use
the GNU version of make.  If you are using Windows, you should first install
the Cygwin utilities, including make and gcc.  Before compiling, you may need
to run:

> export HOSTTYPE=$HOSTTYPE

It's a good idea to put that in your .bashrc or .bash_profile.

If there are compile errors, you may need to customize things for your machine.
You can do this by adding definitions or overriding other definitions in the
sysext.h file, which is included by system.h.

If you need to make customizations for your machine, you should create a new
machine definition in the Makefile, like -DMACHINE_FOOBAR, which matches your
HOSTTYPE.

Then place the code in sysext.h that is specific to the FOOBAR machine inside:

#ifdef MACHINE_FOOBAR
.
.
.
#endif /* MACHINE_FOOBAR */
